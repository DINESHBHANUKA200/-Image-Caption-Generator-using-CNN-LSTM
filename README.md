# -Image-Caption-Generator-using-CNN-LSTM
This project implements an Image Caption Generator that combines Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing to generate human-like captions for images. It leverages a pre-trained CNN model for image feature extraction and an LSTM-based decoder to generate captions.
